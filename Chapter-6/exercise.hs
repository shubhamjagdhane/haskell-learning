{-
-- 3. If you were able to get settleDown to typecheck:
a) What values are acceptable inputs to that function?
b) What will happen if you try to run settleDown 9? Why?
c) What will happen if you try to run Blah > Woot? Why?

Ans: 
  a) Only Blah and Woot
  b) As settleDown take only Mood and return Mood so it shall gives you type error as it does not have instance of Num for Int
  c) It shall gives you type error as we don't have a Ord instance for our datatype
