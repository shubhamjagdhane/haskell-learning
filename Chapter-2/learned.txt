Normal form:
  The expression are in the normal form when there are no more evalution steps than can be token, or put differently, when they've reached an irreducible form.

  Ex. Normal form of 1 + 1 is 2. Because the expression 1 + 1 can be evaluated or reduced while 2 is an expression but no longer reducible.
